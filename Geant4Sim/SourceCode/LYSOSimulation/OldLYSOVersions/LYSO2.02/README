INTRO:

This is the very very early workings of code that's ultimate 
goal is go simulate a LYSO scintillator interacting with 
~1-100 MeV photons. 

Currently, this is just a state where geometry and classes in Geant4
are being tested. This is no were near a final product



HOW TO RUN:

sudo cmake -DGeant4_DIR=path_to_Geant4_installation/lib[64]/Geant4-10.0.0/ ../
sudo make -j 2 LYSOScint
./LYSOScint

VERSION 1.02

Hopefully the fully modeled scintillator as it is going to come to us. Reflector material is BaSO4 which I think is similar to this:

Still to do:

Sensitive detector stuff
Optical physics
